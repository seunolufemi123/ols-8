Notes:
 Refactoring: changing the code so it is easier to understand
  
 

Questions
 Yo / I LOVE that you talk about considering WHO is going to use your code. So important and too rarely considered 
  
 

üñ• Talk: Code Review
[Seun] (15 min) [‚è∞ 40]

Presenter: Riva Quiroga
Contact / social: rivaquiroga.cl / @rivaquiroga
Slides: https://tinyurl.com/OLS-8-code-review 

Notes:
 Code review is a part of the process to ensure the quality of the code
write test (to test the code)
go through code review process: someone reads the codes to find bugs, but also advises on improving code
  The code review process is social. That means that you should take into account that it has all the perks and all the downsides of sharing your work with others. Therefore, it's important to have a code of conduct so people know how to behave towards each other. It's also important to set expectations
 The word 'review' has various meanings, so it's important to communicate clearly what you will review
Code review is a way to transfer knowledge about a project to others
Keep the code review manageable. Don't review everything at once (or only on big points). Otherwise people get overwhelmed and it's very difficult to adjust

Questions
 Yo / I loooooove the way you used fonts alone to convey that code review can be great or scary. Nice one! 
 What  would you recommend someone who is shy to start making code reviews? 
 anonymous peer review isn't really a thing in Open Source, but cons

üë• Breakout discussion: Bug in a scientific tool
[Seun] introduces, [Irene] makes breakouts (15 min) [‚è∞ 55]
15 minutes, ~3/4 ppl per room

Instructions for the room
Think about a bug you've encountered in a scientific tool, either as a writer or a user. Was the software/code open, and if not, could openness have made a difference?

Questions
Could you describe what "root access" means? Thank you :) 
Similar to admin privileges 
Yo: I LOVE the comparison of a software package being like a portable tent. May I borrow that description for the future? ;) 
Yeees!
Again,  What would be main differences between conda environment and docker container? (using the bottle analogy?)

Feedback about this call:
What worked?
 
  
 


What didn't work?
 My Zoom connection. I update the Zoom before joining the call, but didnt re-start computer, maybe that's why.
  
 


What would you change?
 As a speaker, I was too optimistic about the content of my talk covered timely. It was too much for the 10min. Less jokes, more facts :P
  WE LOVE JOKES;)
 


What surprised you?
 The nice and friendly voice of Yehudi 
  The invitation for participate as speaker. It was an honor :)
